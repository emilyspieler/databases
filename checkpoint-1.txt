Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

If you want to run reports on the data, or ask it questions later, a database is a logical choice, especially if you are storing multiple runs in the same database file to look for trends.
If you are only writing the logs from individual runs, and don't need to access the data after it's reviewed, then a text document may better fit your needs.

Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

One difference between SQL and other programming languages is that SQL uses the = sign instead of the == or === sign to indicate equality.

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A database is an application that allows users to manage their data. They store data in a binary file format. Within those files are structures that allow the database to quickly change and read data. These are stored in tables. The values are sorted by rows and columns, which can be searched later for future reference.

Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Table is where the records are laid out, a columns is labeled according to what is stored there, and rows that represent individual items we are addressing (like a customer), values are the individual values under each column within a row (ie: bob's purchase date, amount, and memo)

List three data types that can be used in a table.
